<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>With many new technologies we must be careful about their negative effects, especially when it is the source of student’s education. A negative way a new technology can affect a student is from impacting their mental health. (Mustafaoğlu, R., Zirek, E., Yasacı, Z., & Özdinçler, A. R. (2018).  Poor mental health is correlated with poor academic results. Studies has shown a correlation between poor mental health and poor academic performance, which emphasizes the importance of potential risks by new educational technologies. (Eisenberg, D., Golberstein, E., & Hunt, J. B. (2009) Online learning can have a substantial impact on student’s mental welling being. Firstly, online learning and isolation is heavily connected ever since the pandemic. The lack of interpersonal interaction between teachers and other students can make the student can lead to the feelings of loneliness and detachment, which ultimately effects the student’s mental health. (Kwon, K., Han, D., Bang, E. J., & Armstrong, S. (2010) Another concerning factor is the increase of screen time that comes with online learning. Long exposure to screens, such as computers, tablets, smartphones has been linked to various mental health issues. (Tang, S., Werner-Seidler, A., Torok, M., Mackinnon, A. J., & Christensen, H. (2021) The use of technology associated with online learning can also lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. As students spend a large amount of time indoors sitting down it highly decrease physical activities. This lack of exercise can further impact mental health, as regular physical activity is known to have a positive effect on our overall wellbeing. (VanKim, N. A., & Nelson, T. F. (2013) Additionally, online learning environments may negatively effects students’ motivation. The absence of teachers and problems of self-regulation can lead to decreased motivation and engagement in learning.  The lack of physical interaction and feedback from teachers makes it harder for students to stay motivated and focused on learning, potential leading to a decrease in academic performance. (Kim, K. J., & Frick, T. W. (2011). <p></h4>
