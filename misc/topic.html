<h1>Online Learning & its Effects Students Mental Health </h1>


<h1>Description of the topic:</h1>
<p><em>The area of computers in education has changed a lot over the years because of advancements made in computing. These advancements, such as increased processing power, and improved internet connectivity have helped to revolutionize the way we can learn. One notable outcome of this is the rise of online learning, which has become a popular alternative/addition to traditional education.(Singh, V., & Thurman, A. (2019)) Online learning is defined as learning experienced and interacted with through computers rather than in a physical classroom.  </p></em>
<p><em>Online learning and how it effects student’s mental health is significant because of its impact with the ever-increasing number of computers being used in education. Online learning allows for students to study their course with zero face to face interaction with the teacher or any other students. Online learning can make people feel isolated from their pairs and for some students they aren’t able to learn on their own because of distractions of being at home. On the other hand, online learning can allow for some students to enjoy learning more because it allows them to learn at their own pace rather than be forced to learn at the same time as everyone else in the classroom. Online learning has now been tested on a large scale because of the COVID 19 pandemic which forced students to stay home and complete their learning online. Because of this widespread use of Online Learning more concerns about penitential negative effects on students' mental health has arisen.
